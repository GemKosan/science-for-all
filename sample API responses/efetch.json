    abstract "Jane Loevinger's theory of adult development, termed ego
 development (1966) and more recently maturity development, provides a useful
 framework for understanding the development of the self throughout the
 lifespan. However, few studies have investigated its neural correlates. In
 the present study, we use structural and functional magnetic resonance
 imaging (MRI) to investigate the neural correlates of maturity development in
 contemplative practitioners and controls. Since traits possessed by
 individuals with higher levels of maturity development are similar to those
 attributed to individuals at advanced stages of contemplative practice, we
 chose to investigate levels of maturity development in meditation
 practitioners as well as matched controls. We used the Maturity Assessment
 Profile (MAP) to measure maturity development in a mixed sample of
 participants composed of 14 long-term meditators, 16 long-term yoga
 practitioners, and 16 demographically matched controls. We investigated the
 relationship between contemplative practice and maturity development with
 behavioral, seed-based resting state functional connectivity, and cortical
 thickness analyses. The results of this study indicate that contemplative
 practitioners possess higher maturity development compared to a matched
 control group, and in addition, maturity development correlates with cortical
 thickness in the posterior cingulate. Furthermore, we identify a brain
 network implicated in theory of mind, narrative, and self-referential
 processing, comprising the posterior cingulate cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal
 cortex, temporoparietal junction, and inferior frontal cortex, as a primary
 neural correlate.",
